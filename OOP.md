# What is OOP?

- OOP is defined as Object-oriented programming.
- It organises software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic


# What are the 4 pillars?
```commandline
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
```
# Benefits of OOP

- Modularity for easier troubleshooting.
- Reuse of code through (Inheritance)
- Flexibility (Polymorphism)
- Data Redundancy
- Solving problems
- Security

# Functionality of Each OOP Pillar
Abstraction: Allows you to abstract something away means to hide away the implementation details inside something. Sometimes a prototype, sometimes a function. So when you call the function you don't have to understand exactly what it is doing.

Encapsulation: Allows you to trap something within a capsule/box. Allows you to remove access from parts of your code by making it private

Inheritance : Allows for one object to acquire the properties and methods of another object. This increases reusability levels.

Polymorphism: The condition of occurring in several forms. Types in the same inheritance chains being able to do different things.
