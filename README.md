# Python Object Oriented Programming
## 4 Pillars of OOP
### Methods/functions
#### Modules
##### Libraries- Packages

# Packages/Modules:
# Lucky draw
- key word called import allows you to import from the libraries available within the operator
- . allows you to access methods
```python
import random

print(random.random()) 
# each time it is run it generates a random number
```
# Or you can use this way below-
```python
from random import * # allows you to import all functions
print(random()) # prints the random function
```
